# Dependencies:

Labcraft uses python 3.6:
```bash
sudo apt-get install python3
```

## On Windows:
1. Check Your Python version from the Windows CMD or PowerShell:
``` 
python --version
```
If Python 3.6 or newer is already installed, you may skip to the [Ursina installation](https://github.com/quickMaffs44/labcraft/blob/main/README.md#ursina).

2. Download and run the installer from Python.org's [Downloads page for Windows](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/)


## Ursina:
Labcraft is built on the Ursina engine (https://www.ursinaengine.org)
To install Ursina use pip:
``` bash
pip install ursina
```

Or on Windows CMD/PowerShell:
```CMD
python -m pip install ursina
```

#### Troubleshooting:
If you run into an error concerning a ".deleteme" file, just re-run the installation command.
